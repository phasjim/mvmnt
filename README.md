<i>MVMNT</i> is a Processing art piece that explores the idea of time, space, movement, and destination. <i>MVMNT</i> is a dynamic art piece that animates sketches in real-time, using data extracted from <a href="http://ucenstudent.ucsd.edu/WebCam.aspx" target="_blank">UCSD Price Center's Webcam</a>. The work isolates the movement of the webcam feed and uses that information to track and displace people onto incongruous landscapes. <i>MVMNT</i> is dependent on the activity of the center and creates a unique experience every time. The superimposition of people on top of unlikely settings also challenges the concept of alternate realities and destiny. By extrapolating and utilizing information from the live webcam feed, <i>MVMNT</i> questions the idea of routine and reality.
